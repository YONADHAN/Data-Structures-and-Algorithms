# Tree Data Structures - Study Guide

## 1. Tree Basics
- **Tree Terminologies**: Node, Root, Parent, Child, Sibling, Leaf, Degree, Depth, Height, etc.
- **Tree vs. Graph**
- **Linear vs. Non-Linear Data Structure**

## 2. Types of Trees
- **Binary Tree** (Full, Complete, Balanced, Unbalanced)
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree** (Self-Balancing)
- **Red-Black Tree** (Self-Balancing)
- **Ternary Tree**
- **N-ary Tree**

## 3. Tree Properties & Comparisons
- **Complete Tree vs. Full Tree**
- **Balanced Tree vs. Unbalanced Tree**
- **Degree of a Node vs. Degree of a Tree**

## 4. Operations on BST
- **Insertion in BST** (Time Complexity)
- **Deletion in BST**
- **Search in a BST** (Time Complexity)
- **Allowing Duplicate Elements in BST**

## 5. Tree Traversals
- **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Traversal (DFS)**
  - Preorder (Root → Left → Right)
  - Inorder (Left → Root → Right)
  - Postorder (Left → Right → Root)

## 6. Important Tree Problems (Coding)
- **Check if Two BSTs are Identical**
- **Find Closest Element to a Target in BST**
- **Second Largest Element in BST**
- **Kth Smallest Element in BST** (Using Inorder Traversal)
- **Check if a Tree is Balanced**
- **Count Nodes with a Single Child in BST**
- **Validate if a Tree is a BST or Not**
- **Depth of a Node in a Tree**
- **Implement a Tree with Multiple Children and Display Elements**
- **Height of a Tree (Implementation)**

## 7. Advanced Topics
- **Self-Balancing Trees** (AVL, Red-Black Tree)
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (Graph-related but useful for weighted tree traversal)

## 8. Applications of Trees
- **Spanning Tree & Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**
- **Uses of Spanning Tree**
- **Applications of Trees in Real-world Problems**

## 9. Practice Questions (Leetcode & Others)
- **Leetcode Kth Smallest in BST**
- **Leetcode 200 (Number of Islands - BFS/DFS related)**
